# de Bruijn Graphs & Paired de Bruijn Graphs for Genome Assembly

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms for genome assembly using de Bruijn Graphs and Paired de Bruijn Graphs, as inspired by the paper "Paired de Bruijn Graphs: A Novel Approach for Incorporating Mate Pair Information into Genome Assemblers".

## Overview

Implementation leverages paired de Bruijn graphs to enhance genome assembly by incorporating mate pair information into the graph structure. This method aims to improve contig length and assembly accuracy.
